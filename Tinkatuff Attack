      text: Tinkatuff channels radiant fey energy into a burst of blinding light. Each
        creature within 10 feet must make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw. On a
        failed save, it takes 3d8 radiant damage and has disadvantage on its
        next attack roll. On a success, it takes 1d8 radiant damage and suffers
        no additional effects.
